1. Project Workspace Setup
The mkdir documents command is used to create a new directory named documents inside the home directory. This directory is intended to store project-related files.

2. File Creation
The cd documents command changes the current working directory to documents.
The touch plan.txt command creates an empty file named plan.txt.

3. Content Addition
The echo command is used to write sample text into plan.txt. This demonstrates how to add content to a file using the command line.

4. File Metadata Verification
The ls -l plan.txt command displays file permissions, ownership, file size, and modification time. The output confirms that the file belongs to the current user.

5. File Duplication
The cp plan.txt plan_copy.txt command creates a duplicate of plan.txt named plan_copy.txt, preserving the original file.

6. Directory Renaming
The mv documents project_documents command renames the directory to better reflect the project scope.

7. Archival Structure
The mkdir project_documents/archive command creates a subdirectory named archive inside the project_documents directory for organizing older files.

8. File Organization
The mv plan_copy.txt archive/ command moves the copied file into the archive directory, demonstrating file organization within subdirectories.

9. Recursive Listing
The ls -R project_documents command lists all files and subdirectories recursively, displaying the complete directory structure.

10. Path Verification
The realpath plan_copy.txt command displays the absolute path of plan_copy.txt after it has been moved to the archive directory.
