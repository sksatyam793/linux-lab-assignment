1. File Creation
A file named sample_data.txt is created in the home directory and some sample text is added to it. This file will be used to demonstrate link behavior.

2. Hard Link Creation
A hard link named sample_hard.txt is created for sample_data.txt. A hard link points to the same inode as the original file, meaning both filenames refer to the same data on disk.

3. Symbolic Link Creation
A symbolic (soft) link named sample_soft.txt is created. A soft link acts as a pointer to the original file path rather than the actual data.

4. Inode Verification
The ls -li command is used to display inode numbers for sample_data.txt, sample_hard.txt, and sample_soft.txt.

5. Inode Analysis
The original file and the hard link share the same inode number because they reference the same data on disk.
The symbolic link has a different inode because it only stores the path to the original file.

6. File Metadata Inspection
The stat command displays detailed file information such as permissions, ownership, size, and timestamps for sample_data.txt.

7. Disk Usage Check
The du -sh ~ command shows the total disk space used by the home directory in a human-readable format.

8. File Size Overview
The ls -lh ~ command lists all files in the home directory along with their sizes in a readable format.

9. Link Deletion Test
When the symbolic link sample_soft.txt is deleted, the original file sample_data.txt remains unaffected, proving that symbolic links do not contain the actual data.

10. Disk Utility Demonstration
The du command is used to estimate file and directory space usage, while the df command displays overall disk space usage of the filesystem. These commands help monitor storage utilization.
